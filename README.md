# Hi there!
These are my Leetcode solutions, and starting in 2023, my Markdown notes on how I'm tackling each problem.

# Notes
I don't have notes for all my problems, since I started this a while after I started this repo, but some do. After I finish each problem I'm working on, there will be a Markdown writeup in the corresponding folder explaining my approach. As for problems I'm currently working on, the list is CURRENTLY_WORKING.md, while the actual notes are in the respective directories.
